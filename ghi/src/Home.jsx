                Welcome to our website! My name is Shane Tsui and I am the Regent of the Theta Epsilon Chapter of Theta Tau at New York University for the
                2022-23 school year. Currently with over 100 Chapters and Colonies throughout the nation, Theta Tau is the largest and oldest engineering fraternity
                and we are proud to be apart of its community. Theta Tau strives to develop engineering leaders for service, profession, and brotherhood and we
                are glad to have learned so much from the organization so far! Our chapter at NYU was founded in November 2016 by a group of thirteen friends who
                wanted to cultivate a community outside of the classroom and bring more variety and support to their lives. Since then, we have grown immensely to
                over 100 alumni and active members with various majors and backgrounds and to being nationally recognized as the most professional chapter of
                Theta Tau in 2018! Everyday we strive to better ourselves and each other academically and socially with honesty and integrity.
                Feel free to explore our website, check out our social media accounts, and say hi to us during recruitment week! Thank you,
